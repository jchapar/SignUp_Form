## Overview

This is an intro page that allows a user to sign up for a free trial on this product.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

I started with a mobile first design. I focused on using CSS Grid to help layout the mobile design first and continued using Grid Areas to make it responsive when doing the Desktop version.
After the design was done, I then used Vanilla JS to help with the form validation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS

### What I learned

I got a better understanding at how CSS Grid and Flexbox are used for completing responsive layouts.
As a personal note, I learned that by taking notes of previous courses I've done, I was able to quickly look up and remember how to add JS for the form validation.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/] - I had taken this course a few weeks back. The code I used for the form validation was from notes taken on this course.
